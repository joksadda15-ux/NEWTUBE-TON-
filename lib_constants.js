// lib/constants.js — SEASON 2 UPDATE (FIXED RATES — live pricing removed)
//
// ⚠️ Per admin's instruction, the live TON price system was removed — it
// would sometimes overpay users in TON when the market price dipped. Now
// it's back to simple, predetermined (fixed) rates — predictable payouts,
// no dependency on an external API.
//
// Dropped the two-tier Gold + Diamond currency — now there's a single
// currency: the WTC coin. All reward/fee/withdraw numbers live here.

// ── WTC → real-money conversion rate (FIXED) ──
export const WTC_PER_USD = 25000; // 25,000 WTC = 1 USD

// ── WTC earned by watching videos (via the floating "lootbox" button in the video section) ──

export const VIDEO_WTC_PER_SECOND = VIDEO_WTC_PER_MINUTE / 60;
export const LOOTBOX_CLAIM_MIN = 25;         // minimum accrued amount required to claim
export const LOOTBOX_CLAIM_MAX = 500;        // max credit per network call (to prevent time-spoofing, not a daily cap)

// Daily video-watch time limit.
const DAILY_VIDEO_WATCH_HOURS_MAX = 5;
export const DAILY_VIDEO_WTC_MAX = DAILY_VIDEO_WATCH_HOURS_MAX * 60 * VIDEO_WTC_PER_MINUTE; // = 300 WTC/day (auto-follows VIDEO_WTC_PER_MINUTE above)

// ── The Extract tab's ad-network buttons — each pays WTC directly ──
// adsgramSpecial re-added (was removed entirely per an earlier
// admin request; now back per a newer request). Different block ID this
// time (27566, daily limit 10) than the old one that was removed. "usl"
// (USL Ads / TowerAds SDK) is live — credentials and the loadAndShow()
// integration live in index.html's showUslAd() / getTowerAdsInstance().
// See api/earn.js's handleAdStart/handleClaimAdReward, which check
// `enabled !== false` before allowing adStart/claimAdReward — kept in
// place so any network can be paused instantly by flipping its `enabled`
// flag here, without a code deploy.
// monetag reward 15 → 10 WTC (per admin request — Monetag's
// CPM runs low compared to the other networks, so the payout no longer
// matched what it was actually worth).
//
// AD_MIN_WATCH_SECONDS below used to be one shared floor for every network.
// Split into per-network `minWatchSeconds` here instead, since real ad unit
// durations differ network to network — a single shared number was always
// either too strict for the shortest network or too loose for the longest.
// AD_MIN_WATCH_SECONDS still exists as the fallback for any network that
// doesn't set its own minWatchSeconds (see handleClaimAdReward, api/earn.js).
//
// `requiresClick: true` (giga only now) — IMPORTANT — this flag is NOT yet
// enforced anywhere in api/earn.js. Implementing a real click requirement
// needs to be checked against what GigaPub's own SDK actually exposes
// (their simple rewarded-ad call doesn't appear to distinguish click vs.
// impression — only their separate, bigger "OfferWall" product does, which
// is a different integration entirely — see chat history). Flagging it here
// as a marker of INTENT so it isn't forgotten, not as something active.
//
// ⚠️ REMOVED (this update) — Monetag's server-to-server postback system
// (was handleMonetagPostback in api/earn.js, plus the ymid plumbing in
// index.html). Admin decision: reverted back to the same signed-token +
// timer heuristic every other network uses here, at a 6-second floor.
// `monetag` and `monetagPopup` are now ordinary networks again — no
// `requiresClick`, no postback, no ymid, no MONETAG_POSTBACK_SECRET needed.

    // different call shape from the plain show_9442539() used by `monetag`
    // above). Back to the standard adStart/claimAdReward token flow, same

// actually watched, since this alone isn't full S2S ad-network
// verification — but it removes the "drain the daily limit in under a
// second" exploit, and rate-limits any adapted script to real wall-clock
// time).
// this is now only the FALLBACK for a network with no
// `minWatchSeconds` of its own in AD_NETWORK_REWARDS above (currently just

// genuinely browsing tasks back-to-back gets stopped waiting on it. This

// this — that's a farm script looping, full stop.

// was "3 free ad-gated spins/day"
// (dailySpinsUsed, reset via dailyResetFields). Replaced with a rolling
// cooldown: ONE free ad-gated spin every SPIN_FREE_COOLDOWN_HOURS, tracked
// by lastFreeSpinAt (a timestamp, not a daily counter) — see handleSpin in
// api/earn.js. bonusSpinsAvailable (referral spins) is UNCHANGED — those
// still accumulate separately and aren't subject to this cooldown at all,
// exactly as before.
// the free spin's "ad-gated" claim had
// ZERO server-side verification before this: the frontend just called the
// ad SDK directly and then hit the `spin` action with no signed token at
// all (unlike every other ad-gated reward in this app). A script could
// skip the ad entirely and call `spin` in a raw loop, limited only by the
// old daily counter. Now uses the exact same signed-token pattern as
// claimAdReward/claimLootbox (spinStart → wait AD_MIN_WATCH_SECONDS →
// spin), so watching the ad is no longer purely a client-side honor system.

//    person watching a real ad can't beat 60s in practice. Checked at
//    `spinStart` (before the ad, so honest users never watch an ad for
//    nothing) AND again atomically at `spin`.
//  • BONUS_SPINS_MAX_PER_DAY: referral bonus spins used per day (Bangladesh
//    day). Unused bonus spins are NOT lost — they stay saved for tomorrow.
//  • SPIN_BOT_* : if the last SPIN_BOT_MIN_SPINS spins were all closer than
//    SPIN_BOT_MAX_GAP_MS apart AND their gaps were near-identical
//    (spread <= SPIN_BOT_MAX_SPREAD_MS) the admin gets a one-time alert.
// was 60s. Now = SPIN_FREE_COOLDOWN_HOURS: a user gets
// ONE spin per 2 hours TOTAL (free OR referral-bonus). Before, referral bonus spins skipped
// the 2h rule (only 60s apart, up to 5/day), so farmed referrals = near-unlimited spins.
